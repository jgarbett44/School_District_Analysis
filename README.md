# School_District_Analysis

## Overview 

To prepare a report for a city school board, we are looking at standardized test data and funding information. The goal is to provide insight to help make strategic decisions.

After analyzing the data, reading and math scores at Thomas High School indicated possible academic dishonesty. As a result, we updated the data, removing the suspect scores and replacing them with NaN. How does this affect the data?

## Results

### *Passing rates drop significantly, but average scores barely budge:*

- Average math before = 83.42%
- Average math after = 83.35%
- Average reading before = 83.85%
- Average reading after = 83.90%
- Passing math before = 93.27%
- Passing math after = 66.91%
- Passing reading before = 97.31%
- Passing reading after = 69.66%

- Budget data and spending are not affected.

- Replacing the ninth-grade scores had a negative effect on Thomas High School's performance in the rankings. Prior to the update, Thomas was among the top five schools, ranked #2 overall. Now, they do not appear in the top five.


# Conclusion

The passing percentages play a big role in evaluating and comparing schools. As a result, it will be important for Thomas High School to find a way to submit reliable grades for the ninth grade.
